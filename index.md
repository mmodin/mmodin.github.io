![me]({{ "/img/me.png" | absolute_url }})

My name is Mathias Modin and I'm a Data Scientist / Data Analyst currently working in the eCommerce/payments industry at [Worldline Sweden](https://worldline.com/) and have a background in statistics, economics and econometrics. My interests are primarily in business intelligence, data visualization, time-series analysis and machine learning. I work primarily in R and more recently in Python.

The point of this website is to document useful data science related topics that I come across during my professional and private journey through the world of data science. It serves mostly as a reminder to myself but could hopefully be useful to someone else as well.
